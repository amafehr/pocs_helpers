# POCS Helpers

POCS helpers were inspired by courses at University of Vermont: Principles of Complex systems and Modeling Complex Systems. The helpers in this repo apply repeatable complex systems methods; they are not meant to be wrappers around black boxes--rather, they provide snippets that offer a standardized way to study complex systems principles.

Theses helpers include methods on wranging text and tokens, calculating frequency and rank of types, exploring distributions, a tidy linear regression, among others.

*Repo and Documentation is **heavily** under development*
